# Project-3-CS210-Refelection


#Summarize the project
The project was to make a menu for a list of groceries that were added to a shopping cart. 

#I feel the one thing I did well was the implact different features to my program. I may not have fully implied them. But I did a lot of work on each item themselves.

#I could enhance my code greatly if I could have accually figured out how to empliment two languages correctly. I was only successful in project one. 

#I overcame challenges by first thinking how to apply each element I needed(array or vector was a big thought for the list of shopping items) and then revisiting or watching video on the topic to try and find a more clear understanding of each feature.

#I think I would use the switch menu in many future projects. I find menus or buttons that could use a switch case in my items around a normal household.

#Keeping a program readable with comments is very important. That is the biggest key for other programers to understand your work. I would make my work comments to remind me what I need to edit and then leave them so later others would understand what the code is doing in that specific spot.
